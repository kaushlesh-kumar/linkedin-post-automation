# LinkedIn Post Automation

**LinkedIn Post Automation** is a fork of the versatile tool **linkedin-post-automator** (https://github.com/CRAKZOR/linkedin-post-automator) designed to generate content using local deployment of Mistral 7B model with Ollama. It crafts compelling LinkedIn post content in response to user prompts and can optionally incorporate scraped data from designated websites (currently https://github.com/trending and https://arxiv.org/). This tool ensures that fresh and captivating content is produced regularly without manual intervention.

## üìÅ Project Structure

### üöÄ Main Component:
- **main.py**: This file is the central hub of the project. It seamlessly integrates web scraping, Mistral processing, and LinkedIn content generation. While the original implementation once initiated, it operated in a continuous loop, relying on an internal scheduler to roll out content at user-defined intervals, I have kept the current operation manual.

### üõ† Configuration:
User-specific settings are housed in the `config.json` file:

- **bio**: Your professional biography.
- **gpt_preamble**: Initial instructions for the Mistral model.
- **gpt_token_limit**: The response token limit for the LLM.

- **cookies**: LinkedIn cookies for authentication.
  - To get your logged-in cookies from the browser:
    - Login to LinkedIn.
    - Right-click on the page and select "Inspect" (or Ctrl+Shift+I).
    - Navigate to the "Application" tab.
    - In the left sidebar, find and expand the "Cookies" section.
    - Copy the relevant cookie values.

- **hour_interval**: Interval (in hours) between each post (Not used currently).
- **random_hour_offset**: Max random hour offset added to the interval (Not used currently).
- **random_min_offset**: Max random minute offset added to the interval (Not used currently).
- **scrape_char_limit**: Maximum character limit for web scraping (relevant if "websites" are provided).
- **websites**: An array of URLs for news scraping. If not provided, the tool will lean on Mistral, for example, to generate daily jokes or insights based on the preamble.

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Rename `example_config.json` to `config.json`.
3. Populate the `config.json` file with your details and preferences.
4. Start the automation with:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## ‚è∞ Internal Scheduling
Equipped with an internal Python scheduler, the tool ensures automated content generation at user-defined intervals, enhanced by random offsets for variability. No external cron configurations are required.
